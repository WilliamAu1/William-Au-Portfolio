## Introduction
As part of the Data for Good (Calgary chapter) / GeoWomen YYC's Datathon, participants chose data projects with an Economic, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) focus using public data. This project represents my individual contribution, a project that implements a change detection ensemble model on suspicious transactions in order to target geographical areas and activity sectors for investigations.  

The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre (FINTRAC) is Canada's regulator of proceeds of crime, such as money laundering, bribery and terrorist financing. Regulated sectors, such as banks, credit unions and insurance companies, must report certain transactions to FINTRAC to enable their investigations and enforcement. One such class of transactions are suspicious transactions, where the regulated sector entity must file a "suspicious transaction report" (STR) to FINTRAC whenever it suspects a particular transaction has a higher probability of being a proceed of crime.

Through the Government of Canada's Open Data portal, FINTRAC provides a public data set of aggregate reports by neighbourhood, defined as Canada Post's Forward Sortation Area (FSA) and by sector, updated on a monthly basis. This data set includes 3 classes of transactions: STRs, Large Cash Transaction Reports (LCTRs) and Electronic Funds Transfer Reports (EFTs). The CSV data set is available for download here: https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/81cc47ac-e88d-4b7f-9318-8774a2d919e6.


## Motivation and Objective
The motivation for implementing a change detection model is for 2 reasons:

* Financial crime is often organized. For example, criminals may recruit "money mules" from vulnerable populations in certain areas to spread the risk of detection across multiple persons, often in a common geography. Another criminal strategy might involve spamming the financial system of criminal transactions to get as much value as quickly as possible before being detected.
* Alternative methods for targeting investigations can be very inefficient. Statistical hypothesis testing may be one approach; however, when STRs get so large to become problematic with statistical significance, the time delay to detection may be quite long, allowing criminals to conduct their activities freely for longer. Sampling based approaches are another possibility, but these can be very inefficient as well since rare-event detection can be quite unlikely with sampling.

The objective of this is to develop an change detection model to efficiently target investigations on a geographical and sector basis. This model must have these characteristics:

* Must serve as a timely early-warning system, and not require long lags and delays before alerting
* Must be able to be processed efficiently on commodity hardware with open source software
* Must have low learner bias
* Must have low human bias
* Must have low data requirements (i.e., ideally no data sources outside of the FINTRAC-provided data set)


## Methodology
I modeled positive change detection at 2 grains: at the aggregate FSA and at the FSA-sector combination. The model uses a unique implementation of the cumulative sum (CUSUM) change detection algorithm. In CUSUM, the formula is as below: 

St = max(0, St-1 + (xt - mu - C)); Change event if St >= T

Note that St is the cumulative sum at time t, St-1 is the cumulative sum at the previous time period, xt is the measured metric at time t, mu is xt's long-term average, C is a hyperparameter to buffer out random noise and T is the threshold hyperparameter. 

Traditional implementations of CUSUM often relies on intuition or estimates of the cost of the change to set the hyperparameters C and T. In the STR use-case, intuition may be sub-optimal because criminals often act in novel ways, not to mention intuition introduces the risk of human bias. Cost estimates may be sub-optimal as well, because it can be very difficult and/or inaccurate to estimate costs due to rare-event contagion, social costs, victim costs, etc. 

In my implementation, I leverage grid search over the entire search space of C and T in an ensemble manner. After each iteration of CUSUM within the grid, the model saves the FSAs or the FSA-sector combinations that have St >= T. And after the grid search is completed, the model counts all the occurences of FSAs or FSA-sector combinations as a "vote" to determine the most likely STR anomalies. 


## Exploratory Data Analysis

As the plot below shows, the aggregate number of STRs increases over time at an increasing rate. There is fairly large spikes in 2019 and 2021. 

```{r eda1, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# admin -------------------------------------------------------------------
# ctrl-shift R
rm(list = ls())
library(tidyverse)


# import ------------------------------------------------------------------
# import data, filter to include only FSA-lvl & STR's
f1 <- as_tibble(read_csv(
    "fintrac-canafe_data-donnees.csv", col_names = FALSE, skip = 1)) %>%
    rename(activity_sector = X1, pc = X2, rep_typ = X3, rep_yr_mth = X4,
        rep_num = X5) %>%
    filter(
        str_length(pc) == 3,
        str_detect(rep_typ, "STR") == TRUE) %>%
    mutate(rep_dt = 
            lubridate::as_date(str_c(
                str_sub(as.character(rep_yr_mth), 1, 4), 
                "/",
                str_sub(as.character(rep_yr_mth), 5, 6), 
                "/",
                "01")),
        sector = 
            ifelse(str_detect(activity_sector, "Banks") > 0, "BANK",
            ifelse(str_detect(activity_sector, "Accountant") > 0, "ACCOUNTANT",
            ifelse(str_detect(activity_sector, "Credit") > 0, "CREDIT UNION",
            ifelse(str_detect(activity_sector, "precious") > 0, "PRECIOUS",
            ifelse(str_detect(activity_sector, "Life") > 0, "LIFE INS",
            ifelse(str_detect(activity_sector, "Money") > 0, "MONEY SERV",
            ifelse(str_detect(activity_sector, "Real") > 0, "REAL EST",
            ifelse(str_detect(activity_sector, "Securities") > 0, "SECURITIES",
            ifelse(str_detect(activity_sector, "Trust") > 0, "TRUST", 
            "UK")))))))))
        ) %>%
    select(-c(X6, rep_typ, rep_yr_mth, activity_sector))
# EDA ---------------------------------------------------------------------
tmp_eda <- f1 %>%
    group_by(rep_dt) %>%
    summarise(rep_num = sum(rep_num)) %>%
    ungroup()
ggplot(tmp_eda, aes(x = rep_dt, y = rep_num)) + geom_line() + theme_minimal() + 
    labs(title = "Total STRs over time")
```

The plot below shows STRs over time for each activity sector, with the following insights: 

* Banks, credit unions and trusts show increases over time in both STRs and the variance, the former 2 at an increasing rate
* Precious metals show decreases over time
* Real estate have shown a very recent spike 
* Securities variance has decreased dramatically
* Money services has not changed much over time


```{r eda2, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
tmp_eda <- f1 %>%
    group_by(rep_dt, sector) %>%
    summarise(rep_num = sum(rep_num)) %>%
    ungroup()
ggplot(tmp_eda, aes(x = rep_dt, y = rep_num)) + geom_line() + 
    facet_wrap(vars(sector), ncol = 1, scales = "free") + 
    theme_void() + 
    labs(title = "Total STRs over time by activity sector")
```

The plot below shows the same data, but stacked. This view shows have banks and money services dwarf the other sectors in total STRs, by far.

```{r eda3, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
tmp_eda$sector <- factor(tmp_eda$sector , 
    levels = c("BANK", "MONEY SERV", "CREDIT UNION", "TRUST", "SECURITIES", 
    "LIFE INS", "PRECIOUS", "REAL EST"))
ggplot(tmp_eda, aes(x = rep_dt, y = rep_num, fill = sector)) + 
    geom_area(alpha = 0.6 , size = 1) + theme_void() +
    labs(title = "Total STRs over time by activity sector (stacked view)")
```

The stacked percentage view also shows interesting insights. Not only are banks and money services the biggest senders of STRs, but over time banks and money services became far bigger and far smaller in proportion of STRs, respectively. 

Banks have the biggest, most dramatic change to their STR profile over the entire time-series, particularly after 2014. During this time, there was a large money-laundering case in Canada involving Manulife, that included a large fine and received international news coverage. This event created a lot of scrutiny towards the bank sector, likely leading to their employees becoming far more sensitive to submitting more STRs to minimize their regulatory and operational risks (note that there is no penalty in submitting false-positive STRs in good faith). 


```{r eda4, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
tmp_eda <- f1 Â %>%
    group_by(rep_dt, sector) %>%
    summarise(n = sum(rep_num)) %>%
    mutate(percentage = n / sum(n)) %>%
    ungroup()
tmp_eda$sector <- factor(tmp_eda$sector , 
    levels = c("BANK", "MONEY SERV", "CREDIT UNION", "TRUST", "SECURITIES", 
    "LIFE INS", "PRECIOUS", "REAL EST"))
ggplot(tmp_eda, aes(x = rep_dt, y = percentage, fill = sector)) + 
    geom_area(alpha = 0.6 , size = 0.1, colour = "black") + theme_void() +
    labs(title = "Total STRs over time by activity sector (stacked % view)")
rm(tmp_eda)
# lots more STR in recent times in aggregate (2018+)
# banks and credit unions up, money services kind of up, precious down, 
    # real estate spike, securities flat, trust up
# magnitude in order of factor levels
# banks became way bigger % over time and money services way less
```

## FSA Model
The first implementation of the ensemble CUSUM model is at an FSA-level (i.e., regardless of sector). The voting outcome of the ensemble is depicted in the histogram and violin jitter plots below (note that each of the >1000 FSAs is scored almost 500 times each, for a total of over half a million iterations). 

```{r fsa, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# FSA-level model ---------------------------------------------------------
# aggregate FSA-lvl CUSUM with T and C hyperparam grid search
tmp_mu <- f1 %>% Â  Â 
    group_by(pc) %>%
    summarise(mu = mean(rep_num)) %>%
    ungroup()
# 235 is max mu, 36922 is max st when C==0, >9 trillion combinations of C-T-FSA
# ggplot(tmp_mu, aes(x = mu)) + geom_histogram() + theme_minimal()
# ggplot(f2_fsa, aes(x = st)) + geom_histogram() + theme_minimal()
cusum_fsa <- function(C, T) {
    tmp_fsa <- f1 %>%
        group_by(pc, rep_dt) %>%
        summarise(rep_num = sum(rep_num)) %>%
        ungroup() %>%
        arrange(pc, rep_dt) %>%
        left_join(tmp_mu, by = "pc") %>%
        group_by(pc) %>%
        mutate(
            xt = ifelse(is.na(lag(rep_num, n = 1)), rep_num, 
                lag(rep_num, n = 1)),
            cum_sum = cumsum(xt),
            tmp = ifelse(is.na(
                lag(cum_sum, n = 1) + (xt - mu - C)), mu,
                lag(cum_sum, n = 1) + (xt - mu - C))) %>%
        ungroup() %>%
        rowwise() %>%
        mutate(
            st = max(0, tmp),
            chg_ind = ifelse(st >= T, "Y", "N")) %>%
        ungroup() %>%
        arrange(pc, rep_dt) %>%
        group_by(pc) %>%
        filter(row_number() >= (n() - 1)) %>%
        ungroup() %>%
        group_by(pc) %>%
        filter(chg_ind == "Y" & lag(chg_ind, n = 1) == "N") %>%
        ungroup() %>%
        select(pc, chg_ind)
    invisible(as_tibble(tmp_fsa))
}
hyperparams = list(
    C = seq(0, 240, by = 20),
    T = seq(0, 37000, by = 1000))
f2_fsa <- cusum_fsa(C = 5000, T = 40000) Â # create empty tibble to row_bind
for (i in hyperparams$C) {
    for (j in hyperparams$T) {
        tmp <- cusum_fsa(C = i, T = j)
        f2_fsa <- f2_fsa %>% 
            bind_rows(tmp)}}
f3_fsa <- f2_fsa %>%
    group_by(pc) %>%
    count() %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    arrange(desc(n)) %>%
    mutate(order = row_number())
ggplot(f3_fsa, aes(x = n)) + geom_histogram(bins = 15) + theme_minimal() +
    labs(title = "Change detection ensemble histogram")
ggplot(f3_fsa, aes(x = 1, y = n)) + geom_violin(fill = "green") + 
    theme_minimal() + 
    geom_jitter(shape = 16, position = position_jitter(0.1), size = 2,
    alpha = 0.8, col = "red") + 
    labs(title = "Change detection ensemble violin jitter")
```

The above 2 plots show that only a few FSAs are anomalies in the most recent reporting month. By ordering the ensemble results and plotting the total votes versus this order, I look for a cut-off point on the elbow plot below as another way to determine the change cut-off, which I set at 2 FSAs.

```{r fsa2, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(f3_fsa, aes(x = order, y = n)) + geom_line() + geom_point(col = "red") + 
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(title = "Change detection ensemble elbow plot")
```

So which are the neighbourhoods with the most suspicious recent spikes in STRs? Here they are below:

```{r fsa3, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
hit_list_fsa <- f3_fsa %>%
    filter(order <= 2) %>%
    mutate(Neighbourhood = 
        ifelse(pc == "M5K", "Downtown Toronto (TD Centre / Design Exchange)",
        ifelse(pc == "M1K", "Scaborough (Kennedy Park / Ionview / East Birchmount Park)",
        ifelse(pc == "M5H", "Downtown Toronto (Richmond / Adelaide / King)",
        ifelse(pc == "M2N", "North York (Willowdale) South",
        ifelse(pc == "M8X", "Etobicoke (Kingsway / Montgomery Rd / Old Mill North",
        ifelse(pc == "M5J", "Downtown Toronto (Harbourfront East / Union St / Toronto Islands",
        ifelse(pc == "L3R", "Markham (Outer Southwest)",
        ifelse(pc == "L4W", "Mississauga (Matheson / East Rathwood)",
        ifelse(pc == "V6Y", "Richmond Central",
        ifelse(pc == "V6X", "Richmond North",
        ifelse(pc == "H3B", "Downtown Montreal East", "UK")))))))))))) %>%
    select(pc, Neighbourhood, order)
print(hit_list_fsa)
```

## FSA-Sector
Similar to the FSA-level model, I implemented ensemble CUSUM at the FSA-sector level, which is likely a more useful tool for investigation. Across all combinations of FSA, sector and increments in the grid space of C and T, this model is trained on almost 4 million iterations. Similar interpretation to the FSA-level implementation, the violin jitter plot shows 1 very distinct anomaly in the bank sector.

```{r sector, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# sector-level and FSA-level model ----------------------------------------
# business- and FSA-lvl CUSUM with T and C hyperparam grid search
tmp_mu <- f1 %>%
    group_by(pc, sector) %>%
    summarise(mu = mean(rep_num)) %>%
    ungroup()
# 493 is max mu, 36922 is max st when C==0, >9 trillion combinations of C-T-FSA
# ggplot(tmp_mu, aes(x = mu)) + geom_histogram() + theme_minimal()
# ggplot(f2_fsa_sector, aes(x = st)) + geom_histogram() + theme_minimal()
cusum_fsa_sector <- function(C, T) {
    tmp_fsa <- f1 %>%
        group_by(pc, sector, rep_dt) %>%
        summarise(rep_num = sum(rep_num)) %>%
        ungroup() %>%
        arrange(pc, sector, rep_dt) %>%
        left_join(tmp_mu, by = c("pc", "sector")) %>%
        group_by(pc, sector) %>%
        mutate(
            xt = ifelse(is.na(lag(rep_num, n = 1)), rep_num, 
                lag(rep_num, n = 1)),
            cum_sum = cumsum(xt),
            tmp = ifelse(is.na(
                lag(cum_sum, n = 1) + (xt - mu - C)), mu,
                lag(cum_sum, n = 1) + (xt - mu - C))) %>%
        ungroup() %>%
        rowwise() %>%
        mutate(
            st = max(0, tmp),
            chg_ind = ifelse(st >= T, "Y", "N")) %>%
        ungroup() %>%
        arrange(pc, sector) %>%
        group_by(pc, sector) %>%
        filter(row_number() >= (n() - 1)) %>%
        ungroup() %>%
        group_by(pc, sector) %>%
        filter(chg_ind == "Y" & lag(chg_ind, n = 1) == "N") %>%
        ungroup() %>%
        select(pc, sector, chg_ind)
    invisible(as_tibble(tmp_fsa))
}
hyperparams = list(
    C = seq(0, 500, by = 50),
    T = seq(0, 40000, by = 5000))
f2_fsa_sector <- cusum_fsa_sector(C = 999, T = 99999) Â # create empty tibble to row_bind
for (i in hyperparams$C) {
    for (j in hyperparams$T) {
        tmp <- cusum_fsa_sector(C = i, T = j)
        f2_fsa_sector <- f2_fsa_sector %>% 
        bind_rows(tmp)}}
f3_fsa_sector <- f2_fsa_sector %>%
    group_by(pc, sector) %>%
    count() %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    arrange(sector, desc(n), pc)
ggplot(f3_fsa_sector, aes(x = sector, y = n)) + geom_violin(fill = "green") + 
    theme_minimal() + coord_flip() +
    geom_jitter(shape = 16, position = position_jitter(0.2), size = 2,
    alpha = 0.8, col = "red") +
    labs(title = "Change detection elbow jitter")
```

So which is this suspicious FSA-sector combination in the bank sector? Here it is:

```{r sector2, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# 2 trust, 4 money services, 2 bank
hit_list_fsa_sector <- f3_fsa_sector %>%
    filter(sector %in% c("BANK") & n >= 9) %>%
    mutate(Neighbourhood = 
        ifelse(pc == "M5H", "Downtown Toronto (Richmond / Adelaide / King)",
        ifelse(pc == "M2H", "North York (Hillcrest Village)",
        ifelse(pc == "M4V", "Central Toronto (Summerhill West / Rathnelly / South Hill / Forest Hill SE / Deer Park",
        ifelse(pc == "M3M", "North York (Downsview) Central",
        ifelse(pc == "M9V", "Etobicoke (South Steeles / Silverstone / Humbergate / Jamestown / Mount Olive / Thistletown / Albion Gardens",
        ifelse(pc == "M4W", "Downtown Toronto (Rosedale)",
        ifelse(pc == "V3W", "Surrey Upper West",
        ifelse(pc == "V6C", "Vancouver (Waterfront / Coal Harbour / Canada Place", 
            "UK"))))))))) %>%
    arrange(desc(n)) %>%
    mutate(order = row_number()) %>%
    select(pc, sector, Neighbourhood, order)
print(hit_list_fsa_sector)
```

## Model Validation
Since the data is not labeled, traditional model validation techniques could not be used. Instead, I use a "litmus" test by creating time-series visualizations of the change detection anomalies to ensure the most recent observation appears consistent with a positive change event, relative to the overall data set. Below are the results, and all of them are defensible as strong candidates for targeted investigations:

```{r test, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# hit list viz ------------------------------------------------------------
tmp <- f1 %>%
    left_join(hit_list_fsa, by = "pc") %>%
    mutate(grp = ifelse(is.na(order), "All", as.character(order))) %>%
    group_by(grp, rep_dt) %>%
    summarise(rep_num = sum(rep_num)) %>%
    ungroup() 
tmp_means <- tmp %>%
    group_by(grp) %>%
    summarise(grp_mean = mean(rep_num)) %>%
    ungroup()
tmp <- tmp %>%
    left_join(tmp_means, by = "grp") %>%
    mutate(rep_num_index = rep_num / grp_mean)
ggplot(tmp, aes(x = rep_dt, y = rep_num_index, group = grp)) + 
    geom_line(aes(col = grp), size = 2) + theme_void() + 
    labs(title = "Top 2 most suspicious FSA neighbourhoods vs all observations (both indexed)")

tmp <- f1 %>%
    left_join(hit_list_fsa_sector, by = c("pc", "sector")) %>%
    mutate(grp = ifelse(is.na(order), "All", as.character(order))) %>%
    group_by(grp, rep_dt) %>%
    summarise(rep_num = sum(rep_num)) %>%
    ungroup() 
tmp_means <- tmp %>%
    group_by(grp) %>%
    summarise(grp_mean = mean(rep_num)) %>%
    ungroup()
tmp <- tmp %>%
    left_join(tmp_means, by = "grp") %>%
    mutate(rep_num_index = rep_num / grp_mean)
ggplot(tmp, aes(x = rep_dt, y = rep_num_index, group = grp)) + 
    geom_line(aes(col = grp), size = 2) + theme_void() + 
    labs(title = "Most suspicious neighbourhood-sector combination vs all (both indexed)")
```

Interestingly, the above plots show that the FSA-level model alerts at much higher levels relative to the finer grain FSA-sector model. I would have expected the reverse, since the finer gain is likely to be more sensitive to changes in STR volumes. If I was a member of FINTRAC or some other enforcement agency, I would investigate the reason behind this, which may be something systemic or purely coincidental, but may also be because of criminals adopting strategies to spread their transactions across multiple sectors in an attempt to evade detection.

## Potential for Future Applications and Benefits
FINTRAC, as well as other agencies tasked with financial crimes (e.g., CSIS, RCMP), could leverage this methodology and expand it to suit their investigative needs and lower-level data. Possible implementations could include (list is not mutually exclusive or exhaustive):

* Reporting on lower-level geographies, such as postal walk or customer micro-neighbourhood to match their scope of investigations
* Detecting changes in aggregate STRs where organized financial crime may be more probable to arise, such as by relevant filters/dimensions that are available in STR form fields (e.g., conductors, beneficiaries, holders, owners, directors/officers, relationships, transaction type, dollar amount)
* Creating new metrics for change detection by transformations (e.g., STR:total transaction ratio, adding STRs with LCTRs and/or EFTs)
* Outputting change events with their relevant data fields (e.g., pre/post change levels, conductors, dollar amounts, neighbourhoods) to rank the change events by investigative priority and/or to assign to investigation team
* Using model output to create reports for investigators in the field as a job aid

A successful implementation of ensemble CUSUM can bring a number of benefits, such as (again, list is not mutually exclusive or exhaustive):

* Improved cost, time and/or resource efficiency for investigations
* Reduced human bias in investigation selection, including potentially unconscious bias in ethnic or marginalized income neighbourhoods
* Mitigated social and economic harm due to the ability to detect and stop criminal activity earlier
