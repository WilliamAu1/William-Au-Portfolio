# README

Welcome to my Github repo, where I share my personal portfolio of projects that I find interesting. They are mainly focused on data science and analytics, using mainly R (and Python to a lesser extent). Note that I am the sole contributor to this repository.

I hope you find these projects interesting as well, and can leverage them in your own work. You may find it useful to use specific code chunks for your own user stories.

If you wish to contact me, you can reach me at wiliam.au1@gmail.com or via LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamau1.
