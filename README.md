# README

Welcome to my Github repo, where I share my personal portfolio of projects that I find interesting. They are mainly focused on data science and analytics, using mainly R (and Python to a lesser extent). Note that I am the sole contributor to this repository.

I hope you find these projects useful and insightful - followers most welcome!
